# secretSanta
A program to organise numbered pairs for a Secret Santa event

Enter in the amount of participants you have in your event and the program will pair each number with a different number (it is best to sort your participants into numbers before using this)
*Note: Due to derangements the last person sorted in the program may find they picked themself, in this case terminate and run the program again as the chances of thsi happening are low*
 - However, there is a solution to this case by solving the [The Assassin Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUK4461pRzc), so maybe find a better program :stuck_out_tongue:
